# Why Prototype?
---
## Your mockup never looks like the browser
---
## Easier to find states, paths, and “corners” you might have missed
---
## Instead of describing how to build things in “keyframes,” describe them with the actual thing
---
## Screen size flexibility

# Why ReactJS?
---
## Prototyping applications in the browser is tough
---
### Hard to reuse stuff
### Hard to make things do things
### Hard to work with data
---
## React has just enough out of the box to build a real fake web app
---
## React’s virtual DOM abstracts away the actual DOM so you can focus on components
---
## Component composability is just like HTML classes in CSS, but for markup
---
## It’s just Javascript!

## Components
---
### Components are like widgets or modules: the are the building blocks of a UI
---
### React encourages you to think of your UI as being composed of the smallest possible components you can define
---
### Use JSX to create components in an HTML-like syntax, make them reusable, and combine them into larger UIs
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello world!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<HelloWorld/>, document.getElementById('yield'));
```
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello world!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <HelloWorld/>
        <HelloWorld/>
        <HelloWorld/>
      </section>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('yield'));
```
---

## Props
---
### Props = properties
---
### They’re kind of like HTML attributes
---
```html
<div class="foo" data-bar="bat">Wut</div>
```
---
### Props are defined when a component is rendered
---
### Use props to pass information down to components, this information can be used to change or define content, behavior, or actions
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <HelloWorld name="Andrew"/>
      </section>
    );
  }
});
```
---

## State
---
### Each component has it’s own `state`
---
### `state` is _reactive_...so if you update `state`, the component re-renders
---
### You can use `state` to do basic things like open/close dropdowns, or complex things like simulate a database in the browser
---
### In real React applications, `state` is dangerous, and best to be avoided. In prototypes, it’s your best friend
---

# Design prototypes with ReactJS

# Why Prototype?
---
## Your mockup never looks like the browser
---
## Easier to find states, paths, and “corners” you might have missed
---
## Instead of describing how to build things in “keyframes,” describe them with the actual thing
---
## Screen size flexibility
---

# Why ReactJS?
---
## Prototyping applications in the browser is tough...
---
Hard to reuse stuff
Hard to make things do things
Hard to work with data
---
## React has just enough out of the box to build a real fake web app
---
## React’s virtual DOM abstracts away the actual DOM so you can focus on components
---
## Component composability is just like HTML classes in CSS, but for markup
---
## It’s just Javascript!
---

# So, learn these four things...
---
## Components, props, state, and events
---

## 1. Components
---
Components are like widgets or modules: the are the building blocks of a UI
---
React encourages you to think of your UI as being composed of the smallest possible components you can define
---
Use JSX to create components in an HTML-like syntax, make them reusable, and combine them into larger UIs
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello world!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<HelloWorld/>, document.getElementById('yield'));
```
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello world!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <HelloWorld/>
        <HelloWorld/>
        <HelloWorld/>
      </section>
    );
  }
});

React.render(<App/>, document.getElementById('yield'));
```
---

## 2. Props
---
Props = properties
---
They’re kind of like HTML attributes
---
```html
<div class="foo" data-bar="bat">Wut</div>
```
---
Props are defined when a component is rendered
---
Use props to pass information down to components...
---
...this information can be used to change or define content, behavior, or actions
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var App = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <HelloWorld name="Andrew"/>
      </section>
    );
  }
});
```
---

## 3. State
---
Each component has it’s own `state`
---
`state` is _reactive_...so if you update `state`, the component re-renders
---
You can use `state` to do basic things like open/close dropdowns, or complex things like simulate a database in the browser
---
In real React applications, `state` is dangerous, and best to be avoided. In prototypes, it’s your best friend
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return: {
      definition: false
    };
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
        {this.state.definition ?
          <p>computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language.</p>
        : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```
---
This example isn't particularly interesting without...
---

## 4. Events
---
Events allow you to do things
---
Events can be assigned to any element, and there are a ton of event types available out of the box
---
__Common case:__ click on a button, update the component’s state
---
```js
var HelloWorld = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return: {
      definition: false
    };
  },

  handleDefinitionToggle() {
    this.setState({return: !this.state.return});
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <div className="hello-world">
        <p>Hello {this.props.name}!</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleDefinitionToggle}/>Define</button>
        {this.state.definition ?
          <p>computer program that outputs "Hello, World!" (or some variant thereof) on a display device. Because it is typically one of the simplest programs possible in most programming languages, it is by tradition often used to illustrate to beginners the most basic syntax of a programming language.</p>
        : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```
---
Events can be passed “up” to parent components via props
---
```js
var AlohaWorld = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="aloha-world" onClick={this.props.handleAlohaToggle}>
        <p>{this.props.aloha} World!</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
});

var App = React.createClass({
  getInitialState() {
    return {
      aloha: 'Hello'
    };
  },

  handleAlohaToggle() {
    if(this.state.aloha === 'Hello') {
      this.setState({aloha: 'Goodbye'});
    } else {
      this.setState({aloha: 'Hello'})
    }
  },

  render() {
    return (
      <section>
        <AlohaWorld aloha={this.state.aloha} alohaToggle={this.handleAlohaToggle}/>
      </section>
    );
  }
});
```
---
Forget about CSS, let the virtual DOM do the work
---
```js
// Maybe you've done it this way in the past...
$('.dropdown-menu').addClass('is-hidden');

// Or...
$('.dropdown-menu').show();

// But in React you can...
Dropdown = React.createClass({
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="dropdown">
        <button onClick={this.handleDropdownToggle}>More options</button>
        {this.state.dropdown ?
          <div className="dropdown-menu">...</div>
        : null}
      </div>
    );
  }
});
```
